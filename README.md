# Project Title:- Analyse Historical Insurance Claim Data

## Description
The objective of the analyses is to help optimise the marketing strategy as well as discover
“low-risk” targets for which the premium could be reduced, hence an opportunity to attract new clients.
Insurance Data Analysis Findings
The primary goal of this analysis was to explore relationships and patterns within the insurance dataset. 
Specifically, we aimed to understand how total premiums and claims vary across different dimensions, 
such as time and vehicle types, as well as geographical locations.

## Procedures
Data are obtained by using Python's Pandas library to load the dataset into a DataFrame. Inspection underway such as, 
data types, and summary statistics to get an understanding of the dataset's structure. Data cleaning & pre-processing 
also taken place, by handling missing values. Relevant numerical and categorical features were identified for analysis, 
including Total Premium, Total Claims, Vehicle Type, and Postal Code.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):- utilize visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python for graphical 
exploration. Examine distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data, especially between features and the target variable total premium and total target
The  distribution  of  total  premiums  showed  a  right-skewed  pattern, indicating that while most premiums are relatively low, there are a few significantly high premiums.
This skewness suggests that a small number of policies contribute disproportionately to total premium revenue.
